Interview Questions – Task 1

1. What is an open port?
An open port is a communication endpoint that accepts connections. Attackers can target it if the service is vulnerable.

2. How does a TCP SYN scan work?  
Nmap sends SYN packets; if SYN-ACK is received, the port is open. If RST is received, the port is closed. It's a half-open scan.

3. What risks are associated with open ports?  
Open ports expose running services. Vulnerabilities, weak authentication, or misconfiguration can lead to unauthorized access.

4. Difference between TCP and UDP scanning?  
TCP uses handshake to confirm ports; UDP relies on no-response or ICMP messages, making it slower and less reliable.

5. How can open ports be secured?  
Disable unused ports, configure firewalls, patch services, enable authentication and encryption.

6. Role of a firewall? 
Firewalls monitor and control traffic, blocking suspicious requests and restricting access to sensitive ports.

7. What is a port scan and why do attackers perform it?  
A port scan identifies active ports/services. Attackers use it to find vulnerabilities or entry points.

8. How does Wireshark complement port scanning?  
Wireshark shows packet-level details of scan traffic (SYN, SYN-ACK), making analysis more accurate.
