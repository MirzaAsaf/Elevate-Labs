Interview Questions & Answers

1. What is Phishing?
Phishing is a cyberattack where attackers trick users into sharing sensitive information such as passwords, banking details, or OTPs by pretending to be a trusted organization. It commonly happens through emails, messages, or fake websites designed to look legitimate.

2. How to identify a phishing email?
You can identify a phishing email by checking for:
- Spoofed or suspicious sender address
- Urgent or threatening language
- Poor grammar and generic greetings
- Mismatched or strange URLs
- Unexpected attachments
- Failed SPF/DKIM/DMARC checks in email headers

3️. What is email spoofing?
Email spoofing is when attackers forge the “From” address to make the email appear as if it came from a trusted source. This tricks victims into believing the email is legitimate and increases the chances of clicking malicious links.

4️. Why are phishing emails dangerous?
Phishing emails are dangerous because they can:
- Steal your login credentials
- Install malware, ransomware, or keyloggers
- Lead to identity theft
- Compromise financial accounts
- Spread further attacks inside an organization

5️. How can you verify the sender’s authenticity?
You can verify authenticity by:
- Checking the full email address and domain
- Inspecting the email header for SPF, DKIM, DMARC results
- Hovering over links to see the real URL
- Contacting the organization directly (never through the email)
- Looking for grammar errors, generic greetings, and unusual requests

6️. What tools can analyze email headers?
Common tools include:
- Google Admin Toolbox – Message Header Analyzer
- MXToolbox Header Analyzer
- MessageHeaderAnalyzer.com
- Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer
These tools help detect spoofing, sender IPs, and authentication results.

7️. What actions should be taken on suspected phishing emails?
You should:
- Do NOT click any links or download attachments
- Report the email to your IT/security team
- Mark it as spam or phishing in your mail provider
- Delete the email permanently
- If you clicked anything, immediately change passwords and scan your device

8️. How do attackers use social engineering in phishing?
Attackers use social engineering by:
- Creating fear (account suspension, urgent deadlines)
- Offering rewards (refunds, prizes)
- Pretending to be trusted services (banks, PayPal, HR)
- Using psychological pressure to make victims act quickly
- Social engineering manipulates human emotions to bypass technical security.
